# Future Plans
### Near Future:
- Slot value for inventory layer to be used instead of "row" and "column"
- Ability to use "{CHAT_COLOR}" in item names
- Look into GameInventory, might not be needed anymore
    - Can use "\{" and "\}" to get around this
- Cache items and inventories
- Add a raycastParticles() function that shoots a raycast with particles along its path
- Test the animation system

### Far Future:
- Physical menu system
- Item and inventory default settings
- Item json support for attribute modifier, custom model data, and localized name
- Tons of edge case/error handling
- Bungeecord server network capabilities

- **[9/10/2022]** Rework potion effect handling
