TODO:

Near Future:
- Potion effect handling
    - Three types of effect Minimum, Maximum, and Compounding
    - With Compounding you can make own equation for how each one compounds with the rest
    - Priority system for Compounding effects
    - Effects don't have to represent potion effects they can be arbitrary
- Move ambient, particles, and icon to a effectGroup class
- Add interactions for outside of inventory
    - Dropping
    - Clicking
- Cache items and inventories
- Add a raycastParticles() function that shoots a raycast with particles along its path
- Test animation system

Far Future:
- Physical menu system
- Item and inventory default settings
- Item json support for attribute modifier, custom model data, and localized name
- Tons of edge case/error handling
- Bungeecord server network capabilities

Done:
[9/9/2022] - Json menu configuration
[9/10/2022] - Remove Time class
